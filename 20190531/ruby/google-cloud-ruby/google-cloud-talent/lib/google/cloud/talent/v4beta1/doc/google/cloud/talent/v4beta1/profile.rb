        # A resource that represents the profile for a job candidate (also referred to

        #     and the other one was created 5 years ago. These two profiles may be very
        #     different. The clients can create the first profile and get a generated
        #     {Google::Cloud::Talent::V4beta1::Profile#group_id group_id}, and assign it when the second profile is created,
